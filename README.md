1. At the start of each game, you are given rows of boxes with random numbers drawn from 1 to 4. I will call them the matrix. 
2. You are also given another set of boxes (at length of 3). I will call them noxes (Number BOXES). You can use these noxes to make addition to the outer most layer of the matrix
3. When your addition (nox to matrix) makes 5, 5 (from the matrix) disappears. 
4. Your goal is to make all of the element in the matrix disappear with the smallest number of noxes. 
5. You will be able to see up to 3 future noxes.
